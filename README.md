# Lightning Multi-GPU Plugins Benchmark Suite & Visualization
[![Open in Streamlit](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://share.streamlit.io/seannaren/mingpt/streamlit/app.py)

This branch was used to record results for the Lightning Multi-GPU Plugins Streamlit Visualizations.

Raw results can be found in the `results/` folder.

Due to supporting both FairScale & DeepSpeed checkpointing there is some boilerplate code logic. Recommended to use the below minimal implementations:

- [DeepSpeed](https://github.com/SeanNaren/minGPT/tree/deepspeed)
- [FairScale Fully Sharded](https://github.com/SeanNaren/minGPT/tree/fairscale)
